\section*{Question 0 }
There are a couple of ways this could work.  
If we see substitution of Chinese characters for other Chinese characters, we are looking at a frequency table with an enormous $x$ axis.  
This just means we need a larger corpus to use brute force method.

On the other hand, Chinese is written down phonetically, it would be a frequency analysis on syllables, which is also a larger space.

\section{}
The samples are too short to be analyzed significantly using $\Phi$ on single letters;  they get close to identical values. 
Running $\Phi$ on dimers and trimers yields expected results on all but the first ciphertext, which gets close to 0 for $\Phi$ on the dimers and 0 on the trimers.

This means that no dimers or trimers reoccurred in sample 1, so it is most likely permuted.

\section{}
No, there aren't enough letters to do a full mono-alphabetic cipher.

\section{}
We can discount other cipher systems because it's unlikely that an other cipher system would yield a ciphertext consisting only of \texttt{adfgvx}.



If we assume it's encoded with \texttt{adfgvx}, then it's almost certainly permuted, as $\Phi = 0.00539088589576$ on the corpus broken up into pairs of symbols, which looks just like random text.  If it wasn't permuted,$\Phi$ would be much closer to 0.0385.

\section{}
A $\Phi$ of 0.0363075549455 was found with 115 columns. This was significantly larger than the other $\Phi$ values.  The resulting text:

\section{}
I decided to make a crib of the first 10 occurrences of the symbol \texttt{gg}, which occur at indices \texttt{[21, 23, 37, 73, 80, 109, 123, 127, 194, 208]}.

I searched each substring of the \texttt{3boat10} as the same length as the corpus, looking for an instance where characters at the listed indices were identical.  The found substring was:
